Hi guys!

I'm Kvirkel, and I just finished my MPhil in Economics at the University of Oslo. I'll try to post some old work from my data science classes - hopefully it can be of help to other students. I mostly did R at uni, but am currently branching out to Python for work purposes. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about my code or want notes from courses I have yet to publish.

Please cite me if you use my work :)
